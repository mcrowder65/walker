Minimum viable product:
    We run a java program where we pass in a satellite image of BYU campus and your current location and desired destination.
    We can input how much you care about walking through lawns, parking lots, buildings, etc.
    This gives a shortest path from current location to desired destination.
    We will manually annotate building information such as hours, peak busy times, exits, elevators, etc.

Desired product:
    Create a google maps web component where you can do the minimum viable product plus a simple web interface where 
    anybody can input current location and desired destination (only for BYU campus).
    Users can annotate buildings anywhere.
    Users can input how much they care about walking through lawns, parking lots, buildings, etc.
