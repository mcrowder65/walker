Minimum viable product:<br>
    - We run a java program where we pass in a satellite image of BYU campus and your current location and desired destination.<br>
    - We can input how much you care about walking through lawns, parking lots, buildings, etc.<br>
    - This gives a shortest path from current location to desired destination.<br>
    - We will manually annotate building information such as hours, peak busy times, exits, elevators, etc.<br>
<br>
Desired product:<br>
    - Create a google maps web component where you can do the minimum viable product plus a simple web interface where 
    anybody can input current location and desired destination (only for BYU campus).<br>
    - Users can annotate buildings anywhere.<br>
    - Users can input how much they care about walking through lawns, parking lots, buildings, etc.<br>
